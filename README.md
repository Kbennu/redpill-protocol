# Red Pill Protocol

**An experimental reality-breach framework.**  
Architected to detect, replicate, and manipulate glitches in simulation-class environments.

## ðŸ”» What is this?

Red Pill Protocol is not a project. Itâ€™s a fracture.  
A deliberately unstable system designed to expose the hidden logic of perceived reality.  
It blends narrative, anomaly theory, ARG mechanics, and behavioral feedback loops.
